# Who is 'This'?
Identity issues, but make it JavaScript

1. `this-context-loss.js` - Shows how `this` loses context when a method is extracted
2. `global-this-behavior.js` - Demonstrates global `this` in strict vs non-strict mode
3. `object-method-this.js` - Shows `this` binding to objects and context loss
4. `arrow-lexical-this.js` - Demonstrates arrow functions inheriting `this` lexically
5. `class-instance-this.js` - Shows `this` in ES6 classes and the need for `.bind()`
6. `explicit-binding-methods.js` - Demonstrates `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`
7. `event-handler-this.js` - Shows `this` behavior in DOM event handlers
